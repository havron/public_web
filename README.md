# public_web
my public web files. here is the <a href="https://havron.xyz" target="_blank">rendered view</a>. the site is deployed using AWS S3 buckets, a Route 53 hosted zone, and AWS Cloudfront CDN for caching performance and SSL certification. the files are kept on this public GitHub repository in the spirit of open-source (I welcome pull requests!). you're welcome to contact me via email (havron@virginia.edu) as well.
