# public_web
my public web files. here is the <a href="https://havron.xyz" target="_blank">rendered view</a>. the site is deployed using AWS S3 buckets, a Route 53 hosted zone, and AWS Cloudfront CDN for caching performance and SSL certification. the files are kept on this public GitHub repository in the spirit of open-source development (I welcome pull requests!). you can contact me via email (havron@virginia.edu) as well.
# notes
the HTML files in this repository, other than `{index, 404}.html`, currently lack their file extension in order to serve both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL" target="_blank">semantic URLs</a> and traditional `*.html` URLs on the site.
