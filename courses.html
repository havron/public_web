              <p class="list-group-item-text"><i>Instructed by Mohammad Mahmoody.</i> This is an advanced introduction to foundations of cryptography. We will discuss how to mathematically formalize and construct the basic tasks in cryptography such as encryption, authentication. We will also discuss some rather more advanced and sophisticated tasks such as homomorphic encryption, code obfuscation, and secure computation. Some of the tools we develop in this course might even look like magic (e.g. zero-knowledge proofs, "interactive" proofs that leak no knowledge beyond being convincing). We will approach cryptography from a “constructive” perspective using rigorous mathematical proofs. By the end of this course students should be able to analyze the
security aspects of a system from theoretical perspective, come up with
“right” security definitions, and use the primitives (or invent one!) to
satisfy that notion of security. This would involve a “construction”
and a “proof of security”.
